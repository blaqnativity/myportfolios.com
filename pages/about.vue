        Embarking on my professional journey, I initially found myself in the
        classroom as a school teacher at an early age. Later, driven by a
        curiosity to explore new horizons, I went on to have my first degree
        like every Nigerian kid in Sociology at Adekunle Ajasin University,
        Akungba, Ondo State, Nigeria.

        Joining a startup as a customer success officer, I marveled at the feats
        accomplished by our Chief Technology Officer (CTO). His ability to
        navigate the tech landscape, transforming what seemed impossible into
        reality, fascinated me.

        From my humble beginnings as a school teacher to navigating the realms
        of technology, my journey has been one of continuous learning and
        adaptation. I am now eager to contribute my unique perspective and
        skills to the ever-evolving tech landscape.
