      <p class="text-gray-500 w-[80%]">
        Embarking on my professional journey, I initially found myself in the
        classroom as a school teacher at an early age. Later, driven by a
        curiosity to explore new horizons, I went on to have my first degree
        like every Nigerian child in Sociology at Adekunle Ajasin University,
        Akungba, Ondo State, Nigeria.

      <p class="text-gray-500 w-[80%]">
        Joining a startup as a customer success officer, I marveled at the feats
        accomplished by our Chief Technology Officer (CTO). His ability to
        navigate the tech landscape, transforming what seemed impossible into
        reality, fascinated me.

      <p class="text-gray-500 w-[80%]">
        From my humble beginnings as a school teacher to navigating the realms
        of technology, my journey has been one of continuous learning and
        adaptation. I am now eager to contribute my unique perspective and
        skills to the ever-evolving tech landscape.
